# Advanced-Calculator
Developed a calculator desktop app using Tkinter module and its widgets in Python. This calculator has 3 modes : Basic, Scientific and Programmer mode.

## Properties
* The basic mode allows the user to perform simple arithmetic tasks.
* The scientific mode allows the user to perform logarithmic, exponential and trigonometric operations alongside the arithmetic tasks.
* The programmer mode allows the user to interconvert values between decimal, octal, binary and hexadecimal number systems.
* The modes can be changed by selecting the desired mode displayed on the menu bar, which uses the os module to interact with the file system.
